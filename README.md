# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Josh. I am a Data and Reporting analyst at K12, Inc working with K12's Colorado Schools: Colorado Preparatory Academy, Destinations Career Academy of Colorado, and Pikes Peak Online School.

We've just recently started working with systems that use SQL for reporting and data capture. I am using Python as a data processing engine between our various programs, and really trying git for the first time.

We'll see how this goes...
